# Abstract of the Article

We present a novel iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)assisted multiuser multiple-antenna systems. The proposed approach introduces a joint iterative detection strategy that integrates Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, RIS processing and iterative detection and decoding. In particular, we employ a minimum mean square error receive filter that performs truncation at the RIS and soft interference cancelation at the receiver. Simulation results evaluate the systemâ€™s overall capacity and bit error rate, and demonstrate substantial improvements in bit error rate across block-fading channels.

# Content of Code Package

### This code was developed using MATLAB Live Script and consists of two main scripts: ###

- **iddMIMO.mlx:** In this script, the number of packets remains the same for all SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values.
- **iddMIMO_fast.mlx:** This alternative script allows you to specify a different number of packets for each SNR value.

### Performance Tips: ###
To improve execution speed, especially for large-scale simulations, it is highly recommended to run the code in parallel. To do this, follow these steps:

- Replace the inner for loop with a parfor loop.
- Set the variable useParallel to false.

### Data Tracking: ###
For each SNR value, the code saves the results in the file data/iddMIMO.mat. This enables users to monitor the progress of the simulation in real-time.

### Speed Optimization: ###
If you want to accelerate the simulation further, you can comment out the methods you don't need (e.g., 'iddWOris()'). The generatePlots function automatically generates plots for only the active methods.
